The beautiful graphing library

## why?

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html) is an amazing library. It enables almost any kind of graphing you could possibly want. Lately, though, I've found myself wanting two things:

- Easy [minimal](https://www.amazon.com/Storytelling-Data-Visualization-Business-Professionals/dp/1119002257/) plots without a lot of code required to turn various default ~~chartjunk~~ elements off
- A slightly more intuitive / uniform interface to the various elements. I've only got so much time, and I'd rather not spend it in the docs seeing if I should use `.set_xlim()` or `.set_bounds()`, `.tick_params` or `.set_ticks_position()`.

*less* is my attempt to address both of those personal pain points.
